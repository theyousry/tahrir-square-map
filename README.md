# Tahrir Square Map Project

I've developed a project of **a single-page web application** featuring a map of the most interesting points of interest around **El-Tahrir Square** and i was happily adding functionality to this map including highlighted locations and third-party data about those locations that help users browse all included landmarks, _any selected additional information about a landmark is gonna be_ **powered by [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) & [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/)**.
